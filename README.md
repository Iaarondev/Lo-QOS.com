Lo-QOS: Quantum-Native Operating System Platform

Overview

Lo-QOS is a revolutionary quantum-native operating system that seamlessly integrates quantum computing, blockchain, and advanced AI capabilities. This repository contains the official website showcasing Lo-QOS’s features, capabilities, and the latest advancements in quantum state validation using a layered Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system.

Core Features

Quantum Computing Integration
	•	13D Quantum Processing: Advanced quantum state management across 13 dimensions.
	•	Position-Based Quantum Routing: Dynamic quantum node management.
	•	Quantum String Processing: Real-time quantum state visualization.
	•	Wormhole Communication Protocol: Secure quantum tunneling for data transmission.

Interactive Demonstrations
	•	Quantum Navigator: Visual exploration of quantum states.
	•	Protocol Testing: Live loqos:// protocol implementation.
	•	Performance Metrics: Real-time quantum optimization monitoring.
	•	Layered ZKP Optimization:
