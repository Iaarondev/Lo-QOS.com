# Lo-QOS Quantum OS Website

## Overview
Welcome to the official **Lo-QOS** website, a revolutionary platform built to showcase the next-generation quantum-native operating system. The site highlights Lo-QOS's unique capabilities in **quantum computing**, **blockchain**, and **AI integration**.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Quantum Environment Emulation**
- A browser-based quantum simulator powered by JavaScript.
- Create qubits, apply gates (e.g., Hadamard), and measure quantum states.

### 2. **Protocol-Based Navigation**
- Navigate the site using the `loqos://` protocol.
- Dynamic toggle feature to switch between protocol and traditional routes.

### 3. **Showcasing Lo-Script**
- Demonstrates Lo-Script's 0, 0.5, 1 coding structure with interactive elements.
- Highlights Lo-QOS's ability to optimize workflows.

### 4. **Enhanced Privacy**
- Built with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to validate operations while preserving privacy.

### 5. **SEO Optimized**
- Advanced meta tags and structured data ensure high visibility in search engines.
- Preloaded critical assets for faster performance.

### 6. **Forkable Template**
- The site is fully open-source and serves as a template for creating quantum-native websites on the **Lo-QOS Protocol**.
